instructions:

- all logs should be implemented with Log.d(). if there's already a TAG companion string, you should use it. if not, you should add it.
- all user facing text in the app should be in english. don't include emojis unless the emoji is only an icon. basically no icons + text unless specified.
- do not try to run gradle commands. i will do so when you request it.
- don't be overly extensive when summarizing what you just did. just a small paragraph, then ask me what you need from me in another small paragraph.
